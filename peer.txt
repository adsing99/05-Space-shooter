What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
That by using the randomint option you can append enemies at any random location. 
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I like how there was a bullet limit added to the game. Everytime you shoot a bullet you lose one and can run out. 

 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 The code looks good to me. It is all evenly space and very organized. Possibly less white space

What could have been clearer or better commented?

 There is only one thing commented throughout. Make sure to comment more for others to understand. 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

No, nothing was confusing. 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 describe some of your code and how it translates from code to the game we are playing. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Your code is very organized and impressive. I really like how you used to the randomint for enemies. Also liked the chance of shooting in each frame. Good job.
